                               <p>The goal is to perform funnel analysis for an e-commerce website.
                                Typically, websites have a clear path to conversion: for instance, you land on the home page,
                                then you search, select a product, and buy it. At each of these steps, some users will drop off
                                and leave the site. The sequence of pages that lead to conversion is called 'funnel'.
                                Funnel analysis allows to understand where/when our users abandon the website. It gives crucial insights on user
                                behavior and on ways to improve the user experience. Also, it often allows to discover bugs.</p>

                               <p>You are looking at data from an e-commerce website. The site is very simple and has just 4
                                pages:
                                <li>The first page is the home page. When you come to the site for the first time, you can
                                only land on the home page as a first page.</li>
                                <li>From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.</li>
                                <li>From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, He/she will get to the payment page,
                                where they will be asked to provide payment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information in order to buy that product.</li>
                                <li>If user does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page</li></p>
                                <p>Goal of this project is to:

                                <br>2) Some insights on what the product team should focus on in order to improve

                                and has decided to run a test increasing the price hoping that this would increase
                                revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random
                                sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).<br>
                                The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding
                                how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.

                                <br>3) The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should
                                have been able to get statistically significant results in a shorter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time. Do you agree with
